# Exotendon Variable Stiffness Control

This repository contains all the final versions of the files used in my master thesis. Due to the file sizes, the experiment data has not been committed but can be requested.

## ArduinoCode

This folder contains all the files used on the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller. Further parts used were the Dynamixel XM430-w210-r, a U2D2 controller, a zs-x11h motor controller, a 42bl61 motor, and a AS5600 hall effect encoder.

## CAD

This folder contains the last version of the variable stiffness mechanism with the cable retraction mechanism.

## MatlabScripts

This folder contains the scripts used for the control, collection, processing, and plotting of the data.
